<span class="hl line">   14 </span>ISOLINUX is a boot loader for Linux/i386 that operates off ISO 9660/El
<span class="hl line">   15 </span>Torito CD-ROMs in &quot;no emulation&quot; mode.  This avoids the need to create
<span class="hl line">   16 </span>an &quot;emulation disk image&quot; with limited space (for &quot;floppy emulation&quot;)
<span class="hl line">   17 </span>or compatibility problems (for &quot;hard disk emulation&quot;.)
<span class="hl line">   18 </span>
<span class="hl line">   19 </span>This documentation isn't here yet, but here is enough that you should
<span class="hl line">   20 </span>be able to test it out:
<span class="hl line">   21 </span>
<span class="hl line">   22 </span>Make sure you have a recent enough version of mkisofs.  I recommend
<span class="hl line">   23 </span>mkisofs 1.13 (distributed with cdrecord 1.9), but 1.12 might work as
<span class="hl line">   24 </span>well (not tested.)
<span class="hl line">   25 </span>
<span class="hl line">   26 </span>To create an image, create a directory called &quot;isolinux&quot; (or, if you
<span class="hl line">   27 </span>prefer, &quot;boot/isolinux&quot;) underneath the root directory of your ISO
<span class="hl line">   28 </span>image master file tree.  Copy isolinux.bin, a config file called
<span class="hl line">   29 </span>&quot;isolinux.cfg&quot; (see syslinux.txt for details on the configuration
<span class="hl line">   30 </span>file), and all necessary files (kernels, initrd, display files, etc.)
<span class="hl line">   31 </span>into this directory, then use the following command to create your ISO
<span class="hl line">   32 </span>image (add additional options as appropriate, such as -J or -R):
<span class="hl line">   33 </span>
<span class="hl line">   34 </span>	mkisofs -o &lt;isoimage&gt; \
<span class="hl line">   35 </span>		-b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat \
<span class="hl line">   36 </span>		-no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table \
<span class="hl line">   37 </span>		&lt;root-of-iso-tree&gt;
<span class="hl line">   38 </span>
<span class="hl line">   39 </span>(If you named the directory boot/isolinux that should of course be
<span class="hl line">   40 </span>-b boot/isolinux/isolinux.bin -c boot/isolinux/boot.cat.)
<span class="hl line">   41 </span>
<span class="hl line">   42 </span>ISOLINUX resolves pathnames the following way:
<span class="hl line">   43 </span>
<span class="hl line">   44 </span>- A pathname consists of names separated by slashes, Unix-style.
<span class="hl line">   45 </span>- A leading / means it searches from the root directory; otherwise the
<span class="hl line">   46 </span>  search is from the isolinux directory (think of this as the &quot;current
<span class="hl line">   47 </span>  directory&quot;.)
<span class="hl line">   48 </span>- . and .. in pathname searches are not supported.
<span class="hl line">   49 </span>- The maximum length of any pathname is 255 characters.
<span class="hl line">   50 </span>
<span class="hl line">   51 </span>Note that ISOLINUX only uses the &quot;plain&quot; ISO 9660 filenames, i.e. it
<span class="hl line">   52 </span>does not support Rock Ridge or Joliet filenames.  It can still be used
<span class="hl line">   53 </span>on a disk which uses Rock Ridge and/or Joliet extensions, of course.
<span class="hl line">   54 </span>Under Linux, you can verify the plain filenames by mounting with the
<span class="hl line">   55 </span>&quot;-o norock,nojoliet&quot; option to the mount command.  Note, however, that
<span class="hl line">   56 </span>ISOLINUX does support &quot;long&quot; (level 2) ISO 9660 plain filenames, so if
<span class="hl line">   57 </span>compatibility with short-names-only operating systems like MS-DOS is
<span class="hl line">   58 </span>not an issue, you can use the &quot;-l&quot; or &quot;-iso-level 2&quot; option to mkisofs
<span class="hl line">   59 </span>to generate long (up to 31 characters) plain filenames.
<span class="hl line">   60 </span>
<span class="hl line">   61 </span>ISOLINUX does not support discontiguous files, interleaved mode, or
<span class="hl line">   62 </span>logical block and sector sizes other than 2048.  This should normally
<span class="hl line">   63 </span>not be a problem.
<span class="hl line">   64 </span>
<span class="hl line">   65 </span>ISOLINUX is by default built in two versions, one version with extra
<span class="hl line">   66 </span>debugging messages enabled.  If you are having problems with ISOLINUX,
<span class="hl line">   67 </span>I would greatly appreciate if you could try out the debugging version
<span class="hl line">   68 </span>(isolinux-debug.bin) and let me know what it reports.  The debugging
<span class="hl line">   69 </span>version does not include hybrid mode support (see below.)
<span class="hl line">   70 </span>
<span class="hl line">   71 </span>
<span class="hl line">   72 </span>      ++++ NOTE ON THE CONFIG FILE DIRECTORY ++++
<span class="hl line">   73 </span>
<span class="hl line">   74 </span>ISOLINUX will search for the config file directory in the order
<span class="hl line">   75 </span>/boot/isolinux, /isolinux, /.  The first directory that exists is
<span class="hl line">   76 </span>used, even if it contains no files.  Therefore, please make sure that
<span class="hl line">   77 </span>these directories don't exist if you don't want ISOLINUX to use them.
<span class="hl line">   78 </span>
<span class="hl line">   79 </span>
<span class="hl line">   80 </span>      ++++ HYBRID CD-ROM/HARD DISK MODE ++++
<span class="hl line">   81 </span>
<span class="hl line">   82 </span>Starting in version 3.72, ISOLINUX supports a &quot;hybrid mode&quot; which can
<span class="hl line">   83 </span>be booted from either CD-ROM or from a device which BIOS considers a
<span class="hl line">   84 </span>hard disk or ZIP disk, e.g. a USB key or similar.
<span class="hl line">   85 </span>
<span class="hl line">   86 </span>To enable this mode, the .iso image should be postprocessed with the
<span class="hl line">   87 </span>&quot;isohybrid&quot; script from the utils directory:
<span class="hl line">   88 </span>
<span class="hl line">   89 </span>	isohybrid filename.iso
<span class="hl line">   90 </span>
<span class="hl line">   91 </span>This script creates the necessary additional information to be able to
<span class="hl line">   92 </span>boot in hybrid mode.  It also pads out the image to an even multiple
<span class="hl line">   93 </span>of 1 MB.
<span class="hl line">   94 </span>
<span class="hl line">   95 </span>This image can then be copied using any raw disk writing tool (on Unix
<span class="hl line">   96 </span>systems, typically &quot;dd&quot; or &quot;cat&quot;) to a USB disk, or written to a
<span class="hl line">   97 </span>CD-ROM using standard CD burning tools.
<span class="hl line">   98 </span>
<span class="hl line">   99 </span>The ISO 9660 filesystem is encapsulated in a partition (which starts
<span class="hl line">  100 </span>at offset zero, which may confuse some systems.)  This makes it
<span class="hl line">  101 </span>possible for the operating system, once booted, to use the remainder
<span class="hl line">  102 </span>of the device for persistent storage by creating a second partition.
<span class="hl line">  103 </span>
<span class="hl line">  104 </span>
<span class="hl line">  105 </span>      ++++ BOOTING DOS (OR OTHER SIMILAR OPERATING SYSTEMS) ++++
<span class="hl line">  106 </span>
<span class="hl line">  107 </span>WARNING: This feature depends on BIOS functionality which is
<span class="hl line">  108 </span>apparently broken in a very large number of BIOSes.  Therefore, this
<span class="hl line">  109 </span>may not work on any particular system.  No workaround is possible; if
<span class="hl line">  110 </span>you find that it doesn't work please complain to your vendor and
<span class="hl line">  111 </span>indicate that &quot;BIOS INT 13h AX=4C00h fails.&quot;
<span class="hl line">  112 </span>
<span class="hl line">  113 </span>To boot DOS, or other real-mode operating systems (protected-mode
<span class="hl line">  114 </span>operating systems may or may not work correctly), using ISOLINUX, you
<span class="hl line">  115 </span>need to prepare a disk image (usually a floppy image, but a hard disk
<span class="hl line">  116 </span>image can be used on *most* systems) with the relevant operating
<span class="hl line">  117 </span>system.  This file should be included on the CD-ROM in the /isolinux
<span class="hl line">  118 </span>directory, and have a .img extension.  The &quot;.img&quot; extension does not
<span class="hl line">  119 </span>have to be specified on the command line, but has to be explicitly
<span class="hl line">  120 </span>specified if used in a &quot;kernel&quot; statement in isolinux.cfg.
<span class="hl line">  121 </span>
<span class="hl line">  122 </span>For a floppy image, the size of the image should be exactly one of the
<span class="hl line">  123 </span>following:
<span class="hl line">  124 </span>
<span class="hl line">  125 </span>	1,228,800 bytes		- For a 1200K floppy image
<span class="hl line">  126 </span>	1,474,560 bytes		- For a 1440K floppy image
<span class="hl line">  127 </span>	2,949,120 bytes		- For a 2880K floppy image
<span class="hl line">  128 </span>
<span class="hl line">  129 </span>Any other size is assumed to be a hard disk image.  In order to work
<span class="hl line">  130 </span>on as many systems as possible, a hard disk image should have exactly
<span class="hl line">  131 </span>one partition, marked active, that covers the entire size of the disk
<span class="hl line">  132 </span>image file.  Even so, hard disk images are not supported on all
<span class="hl line">  133 </span>BIOSes.</PRE></BODY></HTML><!--HTML generated by highlight, http://www.andre-simon.de/-->
